# Chapter 1 | Getting Human Growth Hormones

There's 3 ways you can get your hands on Human Growth Hormones

- The black market
- Legally, through a coach/trainer that's got ties because of bro science
- Legally, through a certified private medical consultant

## The black market

[**DISCLAIMER**](https://termly.io/resources/templates/disclaimer-template/#disclaimer-templates-samples) This is only done for educational purposes, etc, etc. I don't hold myself liable for any of the information written here, it's validity or how someone else may use it. It's not my problem.

To get a hold of [PEDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-enhancing_substance) through the "black" market you have the following options:

- Approach someone IRL. I'd say anyone at a local bodybuilding gym has the plug, just ask around

- Use the internet

To use the internet your best bet is to visit a dark market.

To "find" a dark market use a [private search engine](https://duckduckgo.com/) and search for `deep dot dot web links` or anything with the words `market` and `links` and `deep` smashed together. To view these sites you'll need to download and use a [TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org/)

Once you've made it into one of the sites you'll have to use client-side PGP encryption to send your address across and a cryptocurrency tumbler to pay safely. :warning: people get scammed on these markets all the time so make sure you read the vendor reviews first.

## Using someone from the fitness industry

Most people in the bodybuilding community have practical experience with PEDs and can arrange a full end to end "consultation" where you are "diagnosed" with some deficiency therefore "prescribed" with whatever you asked for. I personally avoid these people, they're the worst of all 3 options because a) You are paying the most as it has the most middle men b) there's no guarantees c) No one is really looking after your health besides you while you do it

## Using a certified private medical consultant

This is the option that I went for. I didn't compare the prices with the other 2 and I didn't bother either. It's my first time using hormones so decided to take the safest road.

I started my search by using a [search engine](https://www.google.com/) and looking for "hgh therapy" + the name of the city I'm located in. The search led me to a clinic that advertises itself as offering "health optimisation programmes". The credentials from the doctor seemed legit so I went for it. The way they do it is by:

- Getting your blood tests to make sure you can actually do it
- A consultation to talk about health history, potential problems, etc
- A follow-up to discuss the 2 above + initial delivery of the meds
- Check-ups

Here's my blood test
