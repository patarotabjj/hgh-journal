# Preface

My name is not important. I'm a male, 26. Living in the western part of the planet, in a big city.

I carry a somewhat healthy lifestyle, exercising 3-5 times a week. I don't eat garbage but don't stick to a diet either. I sleep well, I eat well, I train well.

I like combat sports, drugs and techno. As part of my funky lifestyle this shit happened:

Focus on the bottom right and you'll see a textbook [avulsion fracture of the left ischieum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC449822/)

I can't quite remember how it happened. Since I was about 14 years old I had some degree of tendon damage on that area(because of playing football).

However, I do remember with clarity how I tore the cartilage multiple times but can't quite isolate a single event to the fracture. I believe this was something that happened gradually over small impacts/pulls/deadlifts/sparring.

On that same visit to the clinic I got an MRI on my knee as well. I was told I had ACL damage

Surgery seemed expensive, shit and dangerous. Not to mention [insurance companies](https://www.vitality.co.uk/) in this country are out to completely ruin you financially and ["public intermediaries"](https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/) are nothing but absolutely lobby-driven, instransparent piece of shit.

I did a little bit of research, and after multiple consultations with orthopaedists, medical students and people online I narrowed 3 treatment options:

### [Conservative management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_management)

Do absolutely nothing, heal back slowly and go down the physio/rehab route. This is common to avulsion fractures of the ischial tuberosity where the bones tore apart less than 2cm, which is my case

### [Surgery](https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-018-2377-z)

You have to go on all 4s, yeah [literally](https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-018-2377-z), and get the fragments attached together. But what if:

- Your body rejects the screw in the long term
- The person operating damages stuff on the way
- Infection
- Additional costs due to surgery post care

### [PRP injections](https://journals.lww.com/annalsplasticsurgery/Abstract/2008/09000/Role_of_Platelet_Rich_Plasma_in_Acceleration_of.23.aspx)

They put your blood in a blender, the plasma separates from the other stuff that makes up your blood.

That stuff is like a  "biological glue". They inject it into the affected area, it heals faster. 

Costs about £300-900 per injection. I was told I needed 4 and it may not work. Only works locally, no systemic changes. Low risk as it's "your own body" at work


### [Human Growth Hormones](https://asbmr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbmr.5650111217)

>  The results show that GH exerts a direct, nonliver mediated effect on bone tissue. Moreover, the study suggests that hGH may be used to stimulate bone healing and formation in conjunction with osteopromotive membranes

 **BINGO** - it seems as if HGH helps to regenerate just about any other type of tissue, kind off like reversing damage or helping you heal faster.

The negatives are clear as well, the worst one is that if you have any cancerous/bad cells on you, those are gonna grow too. 

It costed me £195/week over an 8 week period. Decided to go for it, I did it through a respectable private medical consultancy. This blog is nothing but an attempt to document from an anectdotical angle the benefits of human growth hormones delivered to a young male that suffered a fracture and tendon damage.

I will try my best to cover all the aspects of the treatment in a transparent and well redacted way.
